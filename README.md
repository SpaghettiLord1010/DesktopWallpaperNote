# Desktop Wallpaper Note
 A small tool to create Wallpapers That are Notes at the same time.

# How it works
 The star of this project is the python script, it generates the image, puts the text onto it and sets it as the current wallpaper.
 When downloading the source, you can copy the python script to the path of the executable and it will work.
 
 If you want the Note to be Multi-Line, add the Â° as a Linebreak.
 Ensure all steps are done and enjoy!
